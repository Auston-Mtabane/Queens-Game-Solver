I’m excited to share that we’re hosting a Testing Hackathon focused on building a strong community and exploring how AI can transform software testing.
The technology is rapidly evolving.AI and tooling are pushing both tester and developer to understand code, data, and systems holistically.In the near future, developers will also be testers and or vice versa , and we want the talented minds at WeThinkCode to help shape this future.

We’re proud to have:

GirlCode sponsoring prizes for top female participants,

UJ TechnoLab providing the venue, goodies, and refreshments

Speakers from WeThinkCode and across the industry, including your amazing alumni, to guide and inspire.

We’d love to have WeThinkCode involved in this exciting initiative.
